### Hi

I'm a computer scientist and software engineer specializing in geometry processing and computer graphics.

I develop and maintain the open-source [Polygon Mesh Processing (PMP)](https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-library/) library and write a technical [blog](https://danielsieger.com/blog) on geometry, graphics, and software engineering.

If my open-source work helps you, consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/dsieger/) me to support continued development and maintenance.
